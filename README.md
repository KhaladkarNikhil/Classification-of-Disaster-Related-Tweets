# Classification-of-Disaster-Related-Tweets
In this section we classify Disaster Related Tweets using different pre-processing techniques and classifiers.
Performed preprocessing using python Spacy Library. 
Used different NLP models like Word2Vec, Doc2Vec for vectorizing the texts.
Performed compartive analysis for the various Classifiers like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Linear SVM , KNN etc.
Used Keras modules for building a LSTM classfication neural net for training and testing classification of tweets.
